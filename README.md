# ProPresenter 6 - Main Output, Message Sender Client
A quick (and lazy) demo of a tool to send messages to ProPresenter6 main output.  I basically took featherbears hard-work with stage display messages and quckly changed the commands sent to ProPresenter to display output screen messages instead.  (Thanks featherbear!!!)

# Instructions
## Enable Remote Operation
* Open Preferences > Network
* Tick "Enable ProPresenter Remote"
* Tick "Controller"
* Type in a password

## Setup the first message in ProPresenter with the 'Message' Token
* This client is configured to display the FIRST message in ProPresenter and any text that is type will be used for the message token "Message"
* Setup the first message in ProPresenter to use the message token "Message" in its Message Text.  Format it how you like. Whatever text is entered into the client will be used for the Message Token.

## Configure the Client
* Press the `Settings` button (top right of screen)
* Modify the `host` address as needed
* Modify the `port` number as needed
* Modify the `pass` field as needed
* Press save
